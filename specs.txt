# future (no particular order)

- samples per period (latency vs resolution)
- play tone
- Noise gate
- tech info (input, samplerate, bits) ?
- Sample rate, drop-down
- add/remove strobe bands
- change options for each strobe band
- choose preset ( 7 octaves, 4 harmonic bands, chords? )
- Strobe color scheme
- Stretch tables
- Partials, text box (drop down with combinations?)
- Mute button
- Resolution (samples per period)
- Sound output, drop-down box
- Pitch standard -> combo box that lists historical pitch standards
- Enable sound output, check box
- Display sharps or flats, drop-down
- Scale & temperament presets
- info display (audio level, concert pitch, chromatic or chosen instrument)
- auto gain (how?)
- Tuner accuracy (strobe speed) adjustment (how?)
- suspend button
- Min audio level (threshold) for pitch recognition (e.g. -40dBFS), slider
- MIDI input to switch modes/notes ?
- Instrument selection (chromatic, std. guitar ...), combo box
- set buffer size (latency)
- Strobe gain/sensitivity slider
- preferences reset button
- proper hash (associative array) implementation for config
- handle audio device changes while app is running (https://www.assembla.com/spaces/portaudio/tickets/158)
- website advice for unplugged electric, touch the desk with the headstock :D
- hsv to rgb vertex shader (or tone mapping)
- read partial data from ring buffer into output () -> lower latency ?
- incremental snac
- note change detection (?)
- write tech info on precision
