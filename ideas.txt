# future (no particular order)


- support retina
- octave font color from strobe peak value
- Vagrant for cross-platform builds?
- Add descriptions and advice to preferences
- Resolution (samples per period, latency?)
- play tone
- sharp/flat indicator
- Noise gate
- keeping strobe phases in sync, how?
- (red) line in the middle or rulers
- tech info (input, samplerate, bits) ?
- add/remove strobe bands
- change options for each strobe band
- choose preset ( 7 octaves, 4 harmonic bands, chords? )
- Strobe color scheme
- Stretch tables
- sprinkle const all over the place :D
- Partials, text box (drop down with combinations?)
- Mute button
- Sound output, drop-down box
- Pitch standard -> combo box that lists historical pitch standards
- Enable sound output, check box
- Display sharps or flats, drop-down
- Scale & temperament presets
- info display (audio level, concert pitch, chromatic or chosen instrument)
- auto gain (how?)
- Tuner accuracy (strobe speed) adjustment (how?)
- suspend button
- Min audio level (threshold) for pitch recognition (e.g. -40dBFS), slider
- MIDI input to switch modes/notes ?
- Instrument selection (chromatic, std. guitar ...), combo box
- set buffer size (latency)
- Strobe gain/sensitivity slider
- preferences reset button
- proper hash (associative array) implementation for config
- handle audio device changes while app is running (https://www.assembla.com/spaces/portaudio/tickets/158)
- website advice for unplugged electric, touch the desk with the headstock :D
- hsv to rgb vertex shader (or tone mapping)
- read partial data from ring buffer into output () -> lower latency ?
- incremental snac
- note change detection (?)
- write tech info on precision
- "fix" stepper behavior (increment/decrement to next whole number or change step to 0.1) ?
- mirroring ring buffer (POSIX implementation using mmap - wikipedia)
- icons in preferences
- reset preferences
- quick help button (?) and/or menu item with a keyboard scheme view
- add menu items
- fsanitize
- modified cepstrum
- frequency domain low pass filter (multiply fft magnitudes by 1's in the
  low frequency range and a linear (or even a step) ramp down in the higher frequencies)
- harmonic product spectrum
- experiment with differentials, demodulations and PLL, schmitt trigger & crossings
